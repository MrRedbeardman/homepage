<p>I&#39;m going to be honest with you&#58; I love to write, but I really don&#39;t like writing about myself. Rather than laying out a series of chronological events, I&#39;m going to share with you some experiences that shaped who I am today. I think this may offer more insight into my character than a cover letter ever can. </p>

<h2>They call me Traveler…</h2>
<p>When I was a kid I&#39; spend my summers traveling with my grandparents. Both of my grandfathers had RVs and loved to sail the interstate seas. Every summer I&#39;d spend a couple weeks with dad&#39;s family exploring the east coast, then a couple more with mom&#39;s side. Both grandpas were awesome story tellers in their own ways. They came from vastly different lifestyles yet were equally genius. My fondest memories of childhood are hanging out in the passenger seat listening to them talk. It goes without saying, but I&#39;ll say it anyway. I&#39;d give just about anything to spend a day in that chair now. </p>

<h2>Fast forward…</h2> 
<p>In mid-2009 the effects of the tanking economy had finally caught up with the projects I was working on. One of my project managers had messed up big with our largest client and suddenly we were out of work to do.</p> 

<p>My roommate at the time was a bartender. When I found out we weren&#39;t working that week, I went to see him. I started venting about what had lead up to the shutdown and a "regular” came and sat down next to me. We had talked football before but work had never come up. He asked me what I knew how to do. Next he asked if I could read a schematic. Then he asked if I wanted to travel.</p> 

<p>I had been doing in-state out-of-town work for a while. I was single and already used to only coming home on weekends. He explained to me that he worked for a company that installed intrusion detection systems on government sites around the world. After grilling me on my experience for about 45 minutes he handed me his card, paid my tab, and told me we&#39;d talk soon. </p>

<p>3 weeks later I was in California. A month and a half after that South Korea. Then Japan. Back to Korea. I could ramble a giant list of places I’ve worked at, but I think Johnny Cash said it best: “Listen, I’ve traveled every road in this here land.” </p>

<h2>The end of that road…</h2> 

<p>After what amounted to about 5 years straight on the road, I&#39;d had enough. I wanted to know where I was going to be the next week. Doing that kind of work you pretty much have to stay 100&#37; travel. There isn&#39;t enough work in one place to sustain it long term. My specialty was running big projects, which often meant no time for vacation or trips home. I was road wary and ready to settle down.</p> 

<p>I&#39;d been in touch with an old contact and he had a part time position open in his IT department. I finished the project I was working on and started my current job in March of 2012. It was nowhere near as exciting as securing flight-lines and armories… but it got me home every night.</p> 

<h2>And the start of a new one…</h2> 

<p>My wife and I started dating a few months after I returned home. We had known each other for a long time, but I had no idea she was interested in me. Once we started hanging out more it all just fell into place. She&#39;s an amazing and brilliant woman… and by far the best thing that has ever happened to me. </p>

<p>I&#39;d been exploring different career options. My forte required travel, and I didn&#39;t want to travel for work anymore. The part time job gave me a chance to try out a couple different things. I helped out a local AV company, a sign shop, and a machine shop. Then I came across a story on CNN about “How to make $30&#92;hour without a degree.” It caught my interest. The article briefly covered web design, the growing market, and the qualifications employers were looking for.</p> 

<p>I started taking classes at www.teamtreehouse.com in July of 2013. In September of that year I finally got full time status in the IT department. Since I work 4x10 hour days, it has given me 3 days a weeks to work on my classes. I&#39;ve completed the front-end developer track and am almost done with the PHP track. The first site I built was for my wedding. The second was for my photos. My first freelance project covered every penny I spent on learning web development and then some. Now I&#39;m well on my way to being a full stack developer.</p>

<h2>The Future... </h2>
<p>I still have a lot to learn. And I’m excited to do so. I think that’s my favorite thing about coding. I can spend the rest of my life learning this stuff and never know it all. So here’s to new adventures, new experiences, and new connections. Let’s build something together. </p>
